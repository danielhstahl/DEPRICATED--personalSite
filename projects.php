                My projects I create to improve my technical and coding skills.  HTML and javascript are simple languages that can be efficiently coded into a phenomenal user experience.  I used to code my GUI applications in java and c++ but was constrained in distribution.  For some computationally burdensome projects I still prefer to code in a lower level language.
